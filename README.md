# pokemon-card-classifier
Welcome to the Pokémon Card Classifier project! This project aims to build a system that can accurately recognize and classify Pokémon cards using a fine-tuned ResNet18 model. The system captures images of Pokémon cards via a webcam, processes them through a trained neural network, and displays the results in an interactive interface.
